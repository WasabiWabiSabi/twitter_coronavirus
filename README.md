# Coronavirus Twitter Analysis

In this project, I used a data set of all geotagged tweets sent in 2020––approximately only 1% of the 500 million tweets sent daily––to monitor the spread of the coronavirus as a topic of discussion on social media. The results can be found visualized in the `viz` folder, split up by language and country in the respective `lang` and `country` folders, tracking the appearance of various hashtags. Although I have not added an exhaustive list of hashtags, representative of all the languages used on Twitter, I made sure to measure the data set for a wide array of corona-related hashtags in a host of popular languages (expanding the hashtag list given in the assignment). The challenges I faced in this endeavor mostly had to do with the size of the dataset––over 1.1 billion tweets––necessitating the use of parallel computing and shell scripts (used to both map and visualize the data set)!
